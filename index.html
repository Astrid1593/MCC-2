                 <p>For my personal project I chose to focus on poverty in the Philippines. Thirty eight percent of people in the Philippines live in slums, unable to provide a suitable living for themselves and their family. They cannot afford basic living expenses or other essentials that determine their quality of life. 
                     My goal was to contribute to the solution of ending poveryu though a fundraiser, with all the proceeds going towards The Good Samaritan Sisters Early Learning Projects in the Philippoines. This organisation aims to help lift young children out of poverty by providing the education that families are unable to afford. Money donated is used to provide chlidren with life skills, literacy, numeracy, and other skills to create a better future needed to create a better future for themselves and their family.

                 <p>I wanted to raise money and awareness of the challenges faced by children going through chemotherapy. I set a goal of rasing $1000 and to do this created a Traithlon. I covered the distance between Mater Christi College and the Royal Children's Hospital;first by walking, then riding, then swimming, and recorded how long each journey took me. I was able to enlist 32 sponsors and raised $1160 in total.</p>

                 <h5 id="diabetesTitle" class="text-success">Olivia Eastwood - Healthy Eating Made Easy</h5>
                 <p>My personal project was about Type 2 Diabetes, which is becoming more common in society each day. I made a healthy eating cookbook, as a preventative step, to help reduce the number of Australians being diagnosed with the disease each year. 
                    Through the project I learnt more about the causes of the disease and the effect it has on many Australians. I gained a deeper understanding about the importance of healthy eating and good nutrition. I also learnt about the correct daily intake of different nutrients. This became a key part of my project as I included the Nutritional Value Tables for each recipe.</p>
